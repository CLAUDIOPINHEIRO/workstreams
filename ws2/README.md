## Meltwater python client

The meltwater folder is a Python package that provides a client to access the Export APIs from Meltwater: https://developer.meltwater.com. Note that we do not provide an interface to all the endpoints exposed by API. We only provide an interface to two groups of endpoints: the "searches" endpoints and the "One-time export" endpoints. However, the client can easily be extended to include the other groups of endpoints.
