# Workstreams

The ALOHA subproject comprises three workstreams
* WS1 local risk
* WS2 regional pulse
* WS3 simulation and what-if scenario modelling

# Workstream 1 - Emergent Risk Index

Create a composed regional Risk Index that takes into account the level of infection rate, % of vulnerable population, and many other factors to assess the ‘riskiness’ of a specific region. How can we help local authorities to decide when is the right time to intervene? 

# Workstream 2 - Emergent Pulse

Create a series of index that can we describe the status of a region, for example; What is the sentiment of the population of that region? How are they behaving? How the news and Media changing? How is the tourism industry being affected?


# Workstream 3 - Simulation Track

Creating a simulation model: What-if scenarios will support Government and Business to quantify the impact of specific measures on countries, regions, counties (i.e. Risk Index) and Industries.
